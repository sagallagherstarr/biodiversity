## Questions to Investigate
1. Observed species diversity per park
2. Weighted (by number of observations) species diversity per park
3. Total number of counts per species
4. Relative frequency of observations of each species, per park and overall
5. Relate each of these to species conservation status, per park and overall

With additional data on park sizes, calculate observation densities (overall and per species) per park, along with conservation status; also, total figures for all parks.
